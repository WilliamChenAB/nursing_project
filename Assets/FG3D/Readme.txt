Welcome To The FG3D /Freedom's Gate Characters)

Warning! With this release the 3D character Rig-Mapping is changed. This change makes it incompatible all hair models and clothes used until now. Even these clth and hair models must be updated to version 2.0


********************************************
************** GETTING STARTED *************
********************************************
it's all very easy

1) Open the demo scene that you will find inside the package

2) Start and try first simple animations

3) Test the blendshape.

4) For add hair and cloth you can use add Item script. To better integrate all LOD levels of various hair and clothes models, evaluate the use of FG3D Customizer. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/76154

5) I worked a lot on weight-map and for that there is already a good compatibility between the various game-object. If you want you can still use the alpha-texutre that I put in the package. Remember to set the rendering mode of the material character on "Cutout".


FGC Male Oscar includes features and blendshapes all other FG 3D male characters and much more.
156 Morph / Blendshapes divided between face morph, expression morph, phoneme morph, body morph and creature-monsters morph.
The face is easily customizable by mixing together  5 different "Vip Morph", 4 "Face Morph", all blendshapes that can change nose, mouth, eyes, etc. and 11 included Albedo Map.
